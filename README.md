# Square Root Calculation via Binary Search in Haskell
Given a double, find the square root of it. 

We cannot use any pre-baked method.

Since [floating-point numbers can't be used for precise computation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24466987/loss-of-precision-sqrt-haskell),
it's ok for this program to return an imprecise result.

In order to find it, we'll use [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).

Will they blend?
